## Definitions

What is Open Science?  

Open science is the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers" ([Hampton et al. 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00402.1/abstract))). 

> The opposite of “open” isn’t “closed”. The opposite of “open” is “broken”.
> — John Wilbanks



## Three messages

If there are 3 things to communicate to others after this workshop, I think they would be: 

**1. Data science is a discipline that can improve your analyses**

- There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data. 
- Your study system is not unique when it comes to data, and accepting this will speed up your analyses.

*This helps your science:*

- Think deliberately about data: when you distinguish data questions from research questions, you'll learn how and who to ask for help
- Save heartache: you don’t have to reinvent the wheel
- Save time: when you expect there’s a better way to do what you are doing, you'll find the solution faster. Focus on the science.


**2. Open data science tools exist**

- Data science tools that enable open science are game-changing for analysis, collaboration and communication.
- Open science is "the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers" ([Hampton et al. 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00402.1/abstract)))  

*This helps your science:*

- Have confidence in your analyses from this traceable, reusable record
- Save time through automation, thinking ahead of your immediate task, reduced bookkeeping, and collaboration
- Take advantage of convenient access: working openly online is like having an extended memory

**3. Learn these tools with collaborators and community (redefined):** 

- Your most important collaborator is Future You. 
- Community should also be beyond the colleagues in your field.
- Learn from, with, and for others. 

*This helps your science:* 

- If you learn to talk about your data, you'll find solutions faster. 
- Build confidence: these skills are transferable beyond your science.
- Be empathetic and inclusive and build a network of allies 

## Build and/or join a local coding community

Join existing communities locally and online, and start local chapters with friends!

Some ideas: 

- [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/scienceparkstudygroup/signup): join this workspace to ask questions and network with other biologists on programming and data analysis topics. [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-fr/features) is a collaboration software used mostly by companies that has more than 10 million users worldwide.  

- [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group](www.scienceparkstudygroup.info): this local [Mozilla Study Groups](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups) is regularly organising local training workshops for biologists that are either beginners or more advanced in scientific programming. [A publication describing the intention of these study groups and how to implement them has been published in 2018 in PLoS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005561).   

- [RLadies](https://rladies.org/). Informal but efficient communities centered on R data analysis meant to be inclusive and supportive. The [RLadies Amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-amsterdam/) chapter is quite active in Amsterdam! 

These meetups can be for skill-sharing, showcasing how people work, or building community so you can troubleshoot together. They can be an informal "hacky hour" at a cafe or pub!

### Naming files

Now is a good interlude to talk about naming things. 

We are going to take five minutes to talk through [Jenny Bryan's three principles for naming files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files):

1. machine readable
1. human readable
1. play well with default ordering
